        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Study Management System, a revolutionary tool designed to help students take control of their academic journey. Whether you're a high school student, college undergrad, or pursuing further education, our platform ensures that you stay on top of your study commitments with ease and efficiency.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to make study tracking not just easy but engaging. Through real-time tracking of study time, our system gives you immediate feedback about your progress towards academic goals, helping you prioritize tasks and ensuring that no subject is left behind.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>At the core of our mission is the belief that well-organized study habits lead to greater academic success. We empower students to plan, monitor, and evaluate their study activities. By visualizing study goals and tracking progress over time, students can efficiently work towards completing each subject's assigned study hours.</p>
        <p>Our tool simplifies the entire process by breaking down large tasks into manageable parts. You can set daily, weekly, or even monthly study goals and watch your progress grow day by day, which motivates you to work smarter and achieve your academic dreams.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>Our platform allows you to add subjects that you're studying, set total study hours for each, and log your study time daily. The system calculates how much progress you've made, compares it to your targets, and shows how many hours remain to complete each subject's study goal.</p>
        <p>Once you select a subject from the dropdown, simply enter the number of hours you studied on a particular day. This action will automatically update the visual progress bar, allowing you to track completion percentages and adjust your schedule to ensure no subject is left incomplete.</p>
        <p>You can also add more subjects over time, whether you’re learning a new topic or dividing a major subject into smaller, focused areas. The flexibility allows you to adapt the system to fit your ever-evolving study plans.</p>
